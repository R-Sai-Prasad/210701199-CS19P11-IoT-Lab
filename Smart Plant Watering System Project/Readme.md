## Water Planting System using ESP32
This paper presents the design and implementation of an IoT-based automated plant watering system utilizing the ESP32 microcontroller. The system aims to optimize water usage and ensure the health of plants through precise and timely watering. By integrating soil moisture sensors, the ESP32 continuously monitors soil moisture levels and activates a water pump when the moisture falls below a predefined threshold. The system is equipped with Wi-Fi capabilities, allowing real-time monitoring and control via a mobile application or web interface. Users can receive notification.. The proposed solution offers a cost-effective, scalable, and user-friendly approach to plant care, reducing manual intervention and enhancing plant growth. This paper discusses the hardware and software components, system architecture, and performance evaluation of the implemented prototype. Initial results demonstrate the system's reliability and efficiency in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels, showcasing its potential for domestic gardens, greenhouses, and agricultural applications.
